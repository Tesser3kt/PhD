 \section*{Methods of Research}
 \setcounter{section}{1}

 The majority of the first year will be spent on research objective 1 -- the
 combinatorial description of higher Auslander algebras of path algebras of
 Dynkin type $D$ and $E$ and their associated cluster categories -- followed by
 a thorough study of the theory of generalized cluster categories (mainly
 \cite[Sections 3 and 4]{amiot1}, \cite[Chapters 5,6 and 7]{amiot2} and
 \cite[Chapters 2 and 3]{guo}), of $n$-representation-infinite algebras
 (\cite[Sections 1-5]{hio}) and $n$-angulated categories (the entirety
 of~\cite{gko}).

 The correspondence between quivers of Dynkin type $D$ and triangulations of
 discs with marked points on their boundaries and one in their interior is bound
 to prove crucial for this endeavour. Unlike in the case of triangulations of
 discs with marked points lying only on their boundaries (giving rise to quivers
 of type $A$), the existence of an inner marked point naturally leads to the
 concept of a self-folded triangle (a triangle with only two distinct sides).
 The first relatively non-trivial task will entail generalizing this concept to
 higher dimensions and understanding the triangulations of a cyclic polytope
 with a distinguished point in its interior.

 In~\cite[Section 3]{ot}, an orientation of $A_n$ is chosen that guarantees the
 equality $\hom_{A^{1}_n}(P_i,P_j) = 0$ whenever $i > j$ (here $P_i$ denotes the
 projective cover of the simple module $S_i$ concentrated in vertex $i$). With
 the right approach, this choice makes the study of partial tilting modules of
 $A^{d}_n$ contained in $\add \prescript{}{A^{d}_n}{M}$ (here
 $\prescript{}{A^{d}_n}{M}$ denotes the cluster tilting module of $A^{d}_n$)
 smooth and elegant. Such an orientation cannot be chosen for the quivers of
 type $D$ or $E$ and thus irregularities will inevitably occur and need to be
 dealt with. More irregularities lurk within the connection between bistellar
 flips of the triangulations of cyclic polytopes and mutations of basic tilting
 modules of $A^{d}_n$ detailed in~\cite[Section 4]{ot}. The issue lies in the
 fact that the folded edges in self-folded triangles cannot be flipped. This
 situation does not arise in the study of triangulations of discs without
 internal marked points and is likely to propagate to higher dimensions.
