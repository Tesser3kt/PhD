\title{Combinatorial Properties of Higher Cluster Categories}

 \section*{Research Objectives}
 \setcounter{section}{1}

 The main objective of this project is to understand and describe the
 combinatorics of higher-dimension\-al analogues of the path algebras (in the
 sense of higher representation theory developed by Iyama in~\cite{iya}) of
 affine Dynkin quivers and their associated generalized cluster categories (in
 the sense described in~\cite[Section~5]{ot}, building upon~\cite{amiot1} and
 \cite{amiot2}, or~\cite{guo}), possibly and hopefully aiding in an eventual
 broader comprehension of the combinatorial structure of
 $n$-representation-infinite algebras (see~\cite{hio}).

 The path towards the goal of this project can be divided into several steps,
 ordered chronologically and quite possibly also by level of difficulty.
 
 \subsection{Combinatorial description of higher Auslander algebras of type $D$
 and $E$ and the associated cluster categories}

 The first step entails expanding upon the research done on the higher Auslander
 algebras of type $A$ in~\cite{ot} with the auxiliary goal of deepening my
 understanding of higher representation theory and the theory of cluster
 categories.

 Dynkin quivers of type $D$ arise (as well as those of type $A$) from
 triangulations of bordered surfaces with marked points -- in this case the
 surface in question is a disk with finite number of marked points on its
 boundary and one marked point in its interior. The most natural
 higher-dimensional structure whose triangulations should describe basic tilting
 modules of their path algebras and also the basic cluster tilting objects of
 their associated cluster categories is the cyclic polytope with a distinguished
 point in its interior. As the higher Auslander algebras of such algebras are
 $n$-representation-finite, the necessary theory is already in place and it
 remains to successfully describe (in combinatorial terms) the tilting objects
 in question.

 Quivers of Dynkin type $E$ do not arise from triangulations of bordered
 surfaces with marked points and thus there are no obvious hints as to which
 combinatorial structure captures the nature of the tilting modules of the
 higher Auslander algebras of their path algebras. Nonetheless, as there are
 only three Dynkin diagrams of type $E$, at worst such structures can be found
 on a case-by-case basis.

 \subsection{Generalization of the theory of higher Auslander algebras to path
 algebras of quivers of affine Dynkin type}
 \label{step-2}

 The iterative construction of higher Auslander algebras detailed in~\cite{iya}
 hinges on the property of each successive algebra being
 $n$-representation-finite and thus having an (up to multiplicity unique)
 $n$-cluster tilting module. In order to study representation-infinite path
 algebras from the same viewpoint, a generalization of this theory which
 compensates for the non-existence of such an object is paramount. An ideal
 generalization would be one that is also symmetric with respect to changes in
 orientation of the original quiver which now influences the structure of the
 associated cluster algebras and cluster categories.

 The construction of $n$-represention-infinite algebras of type $\tilde{A}$
 from~\cite[Section~5]{hio} seems promising but still fully depends on the
 chosen orientation of the graph $\tilde{A}_n$ and in degree 0 yields path
 algebras of the resulting quiver only in cases when the chosen orientation is
 acyclic. I suspect, however, that the latter will be a prevailing issue and the
 path algebra of the (one up to obvious isomorphism) quiver of type $\tilde{A}$
 with cyclic orientation will need to be either excluded or treated separately.

 \subsection{Combinatorial description of the generalized higher Auslander
 algebras of quivers of affine Dynkin type}
 \label{step-3}

 Continuing in the same vein, I intend to find or construct a combinatorial
 structure which would encapsulate information about the (primarily tilting)
 modules of the generalized higher Auslander algebras from step~\ref{step-2}.
 Such a structure will undoubtedly fail to be finite but I find it unreasonable
 to try to predict what it could look like considering I have not yet
 conceptualized, much less studied, said generalization.

 The subcategories of $n$-preprojective, $n$-preinjective and $n$-regular
 modules of the category of finitely generated modules over
 $n$-representation-infinite algebras defined in ~\cite[Theorem 4.18]{hio} are
 bound to prove themselves useful in this endeavour as they allow parts of the
 AR quivers of these algebras to be studied separately.

 \subsection{Construction of a generalized cluster category associated to a
 generalized higher Auslander algebra of affine Dynkin type}

 The final step is to construct a generalized cluster category in a manner
 similar to the one employed in~\cite[Section~5]{ot} for the generalized higher
 Auslander algebras of affine Dynkin type from step~\ref{step-2}. I suspect this
 construction will again be a certain $(d+2)$-angulated $d$-cluster tilting
 subcategory of the higher cluster category associated to the mentioned algebra
 (as defined in~\cite{amiot1} or, more generally, in~\cite{guo}). In any case,
 the resulting cluster category must be $n$-Calabi-Yau, admit an $m$-cluster
 tilting object ($n$ and $m$ need not be equal but dependant), its cluster
 tilting objects should in the 2-dimensional case correspond to clusters of the
 connected cluster algebra and, most importantly, the combinatorics of its
 cluster tilting objects must be modelled in a way compatible (in the vague
 sense of `bearing a related structure') with the description from
 step~\ref{step-3}.
